## 🛡️ Privacy-First Communication Architecture

### Revolutionary Message Privacy Model
**Complete Privacy Protection** throughout the communication flow:

1. **Zero Message Retention**: Messages auto-delete after configurable retention period
2. **Personal Log Integration**: All messages logged to user's own Telegram groups
3. **GPG-Encrypted Transport**: Sensitive content encrypted before transmission
4. **User-Controlled Routing**: Users specify preferred channels and timing
5. **Anonymous Delivery**: No personal data exposed during message routing

### GDPR & Privacy Compliance
```python
# Privacy Compliance Features:
✅ Right to Erasure             # Messages auto-delete, immediate deletion on request
✅ Data Minimization            # Only essential routing data processed
✅ Purpose Limitation           # Messages used only for stated communication purposes
✅ User Consent                 # Explicit consent for each communication channel
✅ Retention Control            # User-configurable message retention periods
✅ Audit Trail                  # All communications logged to user's personal server
```

    """Intelligent routing based on user preferences and message priority"""
    
    # Factors considered:
    - User's preferred channels
    - Message priority level
    - Time of day (quiet hours)
    - Channel availability
    - Message content type
    - Privacy requirements

if request.context_labels:
    topic_id = request.context_labels.get("telegram.topic_id")
    category = request.context_labels.get("category", "general")
    hashtags = self._get_hashtags_for_category(category)

# Automatic topic mapping:
CATEGORY_TO_TOPIC_MAP = {
    "auth": 1,           # 🔐 Authentication & Security
    "plugin": 2,         # 🔌 Plugin Activity
    "payment": 3,        # 💰 Payment & Transactions  
    "communication": 4,  # 📡 Communication Logs
